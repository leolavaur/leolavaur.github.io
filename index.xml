      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Léo I&amp;rsquo;m a doctoral researcher at IMT Atlantique and founded by the chair Cyber CNI. Before that, I received an engineering degree in information security from ENSIBS and worked at Orange Cyberdefense as a part-time employee for three years.
Research Interests My research focuses on the collaboration in security systems, and how to share data without compromising security. I rely on topics like federated machine learning, intrusion detection, and collaborative knowledge sharing.</description>
